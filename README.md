## Organization of the repository

This repository is organized as follows.

"Angiopoietin_Study" folder contains the codes used to produce the results shown in Figure 2 and Section 2.1.

"Qualitative_Dynamics" folder contains the codes used to produce the results shown in Section 2.2. It is divided into 2 subfolders: "Early-stage_dynamics" and "Late-stage_dynamics". Each of them contains data and codes used for Figure 3 and 4, respectevely.

"PARP_Effect" folders contain the codes used to produce the results shown in Section 2.3. It is divided into 4 subfolders: "VEGF_Study" for the results shown in Figure 5B; "EC_Study" for the results shown in Figure 5B; "Tumor_Study" for the results shown in Figure 6; "Cyclic_Hypoxia_Study" for the results shown in Figure 7.
